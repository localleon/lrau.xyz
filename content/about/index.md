Hey, I am Leon. 


I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at RWTH. In my part-time role, I work with on-prem Kubernetes clusters in the energy sector, gaining practical insights into the application of my academic knowledge. I have a keen interest in innovation and keep abreast of the latest technological developments.
