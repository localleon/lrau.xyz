Hey, I am Leon. 

I study computer science at the FOM in DÃ¼sseldorf and work as a system administrator at Amprion GmbH. At my workplace I deal with Ansible, Python and Kubernetes. In my free time I love to try out the latest innovations and techniques. If you want to create an exciting project with me, feel free to contact me!
