Hi, I am Leon.

Welcome to my little personal website. I know it's not much but it's something. 

I am studying computer science at the FOM in Duesseldorf and working at Amprion. Iâ€™m interested in software engineering, cloud architecture and general things IT. I also enjoy working on open source projects, and I am a big fan of 3D printing. And I love new and exciting projects. Contact me if you think I can help you.

This Website was build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the theme [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng). Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

The static site itself is hosted in an AWS S3-Bucket. AWS Cloudfront provides the caching CDN and the SSL Termination in front of it. The SSL-Certificate is issued by Amazon.
