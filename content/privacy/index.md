Because your behavior on our website is none of our business, we do not collect any data about your user behavior and do not record server logs. 

The only metrics we collect are the standard AWS Cloudfront metrics consisting of:

- device category
- browser type
- operating system
- requested Cloudfront endpoint and location of document
