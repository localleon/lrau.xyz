People that start writing Ansible are often overwhelmed by the complexity of existing automation content in a team or struggel on how to structure their own content. That's why i wrote [Leon's Ansible Template](https://github.com/localleon/leons-ansible-template) and published it on Github. This project combines all the stuff that i learned while using Ansible in production for 4 years! 

PS: If you are looking for secret management with Ansible, consider following the examples in the repository [sops-examples-ansible-and-k8s](https://github.com/localleon/sops-examples-ansible-and-k8s).
